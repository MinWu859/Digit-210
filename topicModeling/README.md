# Experience
1. In HTML, I found that when the frequencies of the words are higher, the larger the circles are. 
2. In HTML, The number in the circle represent the topic it is referencing. 
3. I think the python choose up to 10 random topics out of all 209 topics.
4. The script output how many times a special word appear in each of randomly chosen topics; and the percentage of word uses of each topic among the chosen topics.
5. The script output all words across "num_topics" topics after LDA processing.
6. The pyLDAvis use "num_topics" randomly chosen topics to generate the HTML.
7. pyLDAvis list "R" words in the HTML.
# Questions
1. When listing random topics, why does it says "topics[208]="? What does 208 means?
2. What is the purpose of "relevance metric".
